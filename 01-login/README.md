# Auth0 JavaScript Login

This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to a JavaScript application with Auth0. The sample makes use of Auth0's hosted login page which provides centralized authentication.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** box. If you are serving the application with the provided `serve` library, that URL is `http://localhost:3000`.

Clone the repo or download it from the JavaScript quickstart page in Auth0's documentation.

```bash
cd 01-Login
npm install
```

## Set the Client ID and Domain

If you download the sample from the quickstart page, it will come pre-populated with the **client ID** and **domain** for your application. If you clone the repo directly from Github, rename the `auth0-variables.js.example` file to `auth0-variables.js` and provide the **client ID** and **domain** there.

## Run the Application

The `serve` module provided with this sample can be run with the `start` command.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Run the Application With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#set-the-client-id-and-domain).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## Running the Tests

**Pre-Conditions:**
- Make sure you meet the requirements detailed in the [auth0-quickstarts-tester](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auth0-quickstarts-tester#requirements) package. Python, CasperJS, PhantomJS and Docker Desktop must be installed in your host.
- Edit the `auth0-variables.js.example` file adding your own credentials. Rename the file to `auth0-variables.js`.
- Edit the `test.js` file and set a valid pair of `user` and `password` credentials, used to log in into the app.

Run the test:

```bash
npm test
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 account

1. Go to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup) and click Sign Up.
2. Use Google, GitHub or Microsoft Account to login.
